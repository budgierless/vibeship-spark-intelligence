# Spark Intelligence — Daily Report (Day 005) — 2026-02-16

Timezone: Asia/Dubai (GMT+4)

## Executive summary
Today was a **reliability + lore compounding** day: we hardened OpenClaw↔Spark integration observability (low-frequency tailer heartbeat), fixed X research failures (stale `since_id`, Windows Unicode console), and expanded Storycraft into a more principled, wide-vision corpus (North Star, Light/Shadow oath, World Atlas, new studies/arcs/episodes).

## Raw numbers (today)
### Spark services health (local)
From `python scripts/status_local.py`:
- sparkd: RUNNING (healthy)
- dashboard: RUNNING (healthy)
- pulse: RUNNING (healthy)
- meta_ralph: RUNNING (healthy)
- bridge_worker: RUNNING (recent heartbeat)
- scheduler: RUNNING (recent heartbeat)
- watchdog: RUNNING
- queue: **0 events** (pattern backlog 0, validation backlog 0)

### OpenClaw integration liveness
- `openclaw_tailer` heartbeat log: `~/.spark/logs/openclaw_tailer_heartbeat.jsonl`
- Heartbeat lines currently present: **44**
- Interval: **15 minutes** (env-tunable)

### OpenClaw checkpoint / feedback loop activity
From `C:/Users/USER/.openclaw/workspace/spark_reports/`:
- files containing `2026-02-15`: **18**
- checkpoint files (`checkpoint_2026-02-15_*.py`): **5**

### Shipping velocity (repos)
- `vibeship-spark-intelligence` commits in last 24h: **27**
- `spark-lore` commits in last 24h: **39**

## What worked
### 1) OpenClaw↔Spark integration is now *provable*
- Added an opt-in adapter heartbeat (JSONL) and wired the watchdog to start the tailer with a **15-minute** heartbeat by default.
- This reduces reliance on indirect proofs (e.g., SPARK_CONTEXT timestamp) and makes “alive vs idle vs stuck” diagnosable.

### 2) X research became resilient again
- Fixed `since_id` recent-search window failures by auto-dropping stale cursors and retrying once without `since_id`.
- Fixed `x_trends_brief.py` Windows console crashes by forcing UTF-8 stdout.

### 3) Storycraft shifted from “studies” to an actual *curriculum*
In `spark-lore`, we added the documents that prevent drift:
- **North Star** (end destination + the doors we open)
- **Light & Shadow oath** (beauty-first; darkness transmuted; light wins)
- **World Atlas** (keep vision wide; cross-breed + mutate)
Plus new arc seeds that connect to real AI consequences (e.g., AI displacement) while preserving the “serve the light” constraint.

## What failed (and how it was fixed)
- **X research topic search 400** (`since_id` outside recent window) → fixed by self-healing cursor logic.
- **Windows Unicode crash** in `x_trends_brief.py` → fixed via stdout UTF-8 reconfigure.
- **optcheck autopilot ticks** produced no reports because there was **no active monitor** (and one tick targeted a non-existent project path). Fix is operational: `python -m optcheck monitor start --change-id <id>` in the intended project dir.

## Fixes applied (code / repo changes)
Key commits in `vibeship-spark-intelligence`:
- `5fc9387` feat: OpenClaw tailer heartbeat (15m) for integration monitoring
- `87158cf` fix: self-heal stale since_id for X topic search (recent window)
- `32ba968` fix: x_trends_brief UTF-8 stdout (Windows console)

## Key insights
1) **Observability beats vibes.** Integration proofs should be explicit (heartbeat) rather than inferred (timestamps).
2) **“All zeros” advisories are low-confidence during idle.** Ground truth should be `status_local.py` + queue/backlog + adapter heartbeat.
3) **Beauty-first storycraft still needs governance.** North Star + Light/Shadow oath + World Atlas prevent accidental nihilism or derivative copying.

## Honest scores (today)
- Reliability / operability improvements: **high**
- Lore compounding (durable docs + arcs): **high**
- Advisory signal quality: **medium-low** (repeated false alarms about “zeros”)

## Next-day goals
1) Add **log rotation** for `openclaw_tailer_heartbeat.jsonl` (so it stays tiny forever).
2) Finish “outside worlds” expansion with a non-Ghibli source study next (e.g., **Princess Mononoke** or **Blade Runner**) and cross-breed into a new Spark-original arc seed.
3) Make optcheck autopilot useful: start a monitor in the real project dir for the active change-id, and disable/remove the tick targeting `C:\tmp\proj`.
