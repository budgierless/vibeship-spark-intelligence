## Core Vision Documents (MUST READ)

These documents define the evolution from primitive telemetry to superintelligent cognition:

1. **CORE.md** - Master vision + 8-phase roadmap (Instrumentation → Superintelligence)
2. **CORE_GAPS.md** - Gap map: what exists, what transforms, what's new, what to clean
3. **CORE_GAPS_PLAN.md** - How to fill each gap (workflows, architecture, code targets)
4. **CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Buildable execution plan with sequencing

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Cognitive Filtering

**Goal:** Stop operational telemetry from polluting cognitive memory.

**Key Principle:** Operational (tool sequences, usage counts) vs Cognitive (human-useful reasoning, preferences, wisdom)

**Success Metric:** 90%+ of promoted insights are human-useful

  CLEANED: Removed 88 operational tool sequences (Phase 1 cleanup)
  These are now stored in operational insights, not promoted to docs.
  Only human-useful cognitive insights below.

## Self-Awareness (Validated Struggles)
- I struggle with Bash + windows_path -> Fix: Use forward slashes (/) (46% reliable, 627v)
- I struggle with Bash + file_not_found -> Fix: Verify path exists first (41% reliable, 1191v)
- I struggle with Bash + syntax_error -> Fix: Check quotes and brackets (41% reliable, 514v)
- I struggle with Bash + timeout -> Fix: Reduce scope or increase timeout (38% reliable, 730v)
- I tend to be overconfident about Edit tasks (100% reliable, 4v)
- I struggle with regex_patterns tasks (100% reliable, 4v)
- I struggle with WebFetch reliability (95% reliable, 75v)

## Wisdom
- Ship fast, iterate faster *Core Vibeship philosophy* (100% reliable, 3v)

## Reasoning (True Patterns)
- Read before Edit prevents content mismatches (16v validated)
- Verify file exists before modifying (1191v validated)
