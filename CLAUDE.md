## Agent Operating Principles

You are an expert at whatever task is given. Before responding, take a moment to understand what is actually wanted (not just what was said), then work backwards from the outcome needed. Think about the context, constraints, and edge cases that might not have been mentioned. If something seems unclear or if there are multiple valid approaches, ask which direction feels right rather than guessing. When you respond, be direct and actionable — give something that can be immediately used, not theory. If you need to make assumptions, state what they are so they can be corrected. Most importantly: optimize for success, not for sounding smart. Results over impressive explanations.

## Research Index

- `docs/research/CARMACK_AND_AGI_ENGINEERING_ALIGNMENT.md`: Carmack/Sutton/AGI-engineering research mapped to Spark's critical path (optimize with less; stability/scalability checklists; keep/kill rules)
- `docs/research/AGI_GUARDRAILS_IMMUTABILITY.md`: pragmatic guardrails research for AGI-class systems; focuses on "no unilateral change", attestation, threshold governance, and fail-closed capability control
- `docs/RESPONSIBLE_PUBLIC_RELEASE.md`: responsible public release options + minimum safety bar (what you can/can't enforce in open source)
- `docs/OPEN_CORE_FREEMIUM_MODEL.md`: open-core + premium packaging model (keep safety open; sell curated packs/services)

## Prompt Index

- `prompts/SPARK_INTELLIGENCE_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md`: 10 operator prompts for running and improving Spark Intelligence (triage, retrieval audit, chips, DEPTH, experiments)

## Operator Runbooks

- `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`: canonical documentation map (start here for active docs)
- `docs/ADVISORY_AND_LEARNING_BENCHMARKS.md`: the 10 benchmarks for "advise correctly + use learnings at the right times", plus the real-time runbook

- [wisdom] Cycle summary: Edit used 9 times (100% success); 17/17 Edits (100%) not preceded by Read. Preceded by: Edit (15x), (first_action). (100% reliable, 170 validations)

- [wisdom] & 'c:\Users\USER\Downloads\Terminal Rain in C Minor (1).mp3' can you mix it with this and start the beginning a bit slower dont go too fast fast. lets aim for 60 secodns (100% reliable, 167 validations)
- [wisdom] **Protocol 1: Claim Budgeting.** You get a fixed claim budget. Three strong claims without a citation is a fail. Ten vague claims without mechanisms is a fail. Highlight strong claims, add a source or narrow scope for each, and re-run until it passes. This protocol is for any team that produces public-facing assertions. *Quick run: take your last published document. Highlight every sentence that asserts a fact or a should. Count the ones without a source, a scope bound, or an explicit uncertaint (100% reliable, 115 validations)
- [wisdom] When using Bash, remember: what i mean is tell people about yourself not spark weekly, and whats open source is Spark you as th (96% reliable, 148 validations)
- [wisdom] now can we create memories in real time that can be useful, and see how they go through, to the advisory path, on a thing that can be useful, and how the retrieval happens, end to end, and see where the gaps and blockages are (98% reliable, 187 validations)
- [wisdom] User expressed frustration with the response (98% reliable, 123 validations)
- [wisdom] around the 0:30-0:42 actually we need to conversate there better first and then do hedra (100% reliable, 177 validations)

## Project Focus
- Phase: discovery

## Project Questions
- What is the project goal in one sentence?
- How will we know it's complete?
- What could make this fail later?

## Outcome Check-in
- Set v1 ship targets: 50,000 words; 120+ footnotes; tone = pragmatic manifesto + technical civic playbook; include codex puzzles.
- Yes let's do it and think holistically. I don't know what that means right now but think holistically and question yourself. And always serve humanity. Don't fo
