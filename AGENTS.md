- I would say making the environment look better is going to be important too. The environment can definitely look better, also the camera angles right now. The good part is we can actually move the camera a bit, but in these types of games, being able to really be able to look at the shot from a great camera angle is going to be very important. Also, the scene is the environment is very dark and doesn't have much right now. Can we actually put more attention to detail? If necessary, we can always be like, "Okay, for these types of things that's actually generates some 3D environments" or for these types of things that's actually generates certain textures or things of that nature that will make the games instantly look better. I think that is what's necessary too. On another thing that I realised was there were these circle blobs in the centre of the lobsters. If you want to put basically things that will colour them, let's put them above them but in a smaller way instead of trying to have this circle in the centre of the lobsters which actually looks weird. *When: auto-captured from conversation* (99% reliable, 269 validations)
