- I would say making the environment look better is going to be important too. The environment can definitely look better, also the camera angles right now. The good part is we can actually move the camera a bit, but in these types of games, being able to really be able to look at the shot from a great camera angle is going to be very important. Also, the scene is the environment is very dark and doesn't have much right now. Can we actually put more attention to detail? If necessary, we can always be like, "Okay, for these types of things that's actually generates some 3D environments" or for these types of things that's actually generates certain textures or things of that nature that will make the games instantly look better. I think that is what's necessary too. On another thing that I realised was there were these circle blobs in the centre of the lobsters. If you want to put basically things that will colour them, let's put them above them but in a smaller way instead of trying to have this circle in the centre of the lobsters which actually looks weird. *When: auto-captured from conversation* (99% reliable, 269 validations)

- c:\Users\USER\Desktop\vibeship-spark-pulse This was the place where the real pulse exists. By the way, let's save this to the MD file and clean the pulse that you just showed me. Like that's not how we use pulse. *When: auto-captured from conversation* (96% reliable, 48 validations)

  # 🧠 SPARK INTELLIGENCE ACTIVATION

  ## STEP 1: Verify Spark Status
  Before starting work, check Spark is running:
  - Spark Dashboard: http://localhost:8585
  - Spark Pulse: http://localhost:8765
  - Mind API: http://localhost:8080

  If not running, start with: `python -m spark.cli up` from vibeship-spark-intelligence

  ## STEP 2: Project Onboarding (ANSWER THESE)

  **Domain**: [What domain is this project? e.g., game_dev, marketing, fintech, SaaS, web3]        
  **Success**: [What does success look like for this project?]
  **Focus**: [What should I pay attention to and learn from?]
  **Avoid**: [What mistakes should I help avoid?]
  **Constraints**: [Any tech/time/scope constraints?]

  ## STEP 3: Activate Relevant Chips

  Available chips (activate based on domain):
  - `spark-core` - Core Spark patterns (always active)
  - `vibecoding` - Coding standards and patterns
  - `game_dev` - Game development patterns
  - `marketing` - Marketing and content
  - `market-intel` - Market research
  - `biz-ops` - Business operations
  - `moltbook` - Prediction markets/betting
  - `bench_core` - Benchmarking

  ## STEP 4: EIDOS Protocol (ENFORCE THIS)

  ### The Vertical Loop (Every Action)
  1. ACTION → What am I doing?
  2. PREDICTION → What do I expect? (confidence 0-1)
  3. OUTCOME → What actually happened?
  4. EVALUATION → Did prediction match?
  5. LESSON → What's the reusable insight?

  ### Hard Gates (Never Break)
  1. **No action without falsifiable hypothesis**
  2. **Two failures = STOP modifying** (only observe/diagnose)
  3. **Progress must be observable** (every step changes something)
  4. **Budgets are capped** (25 steps, 12 min, 2 retries per error)
  5. **Memory must be consulted** (cite or declare absent)

  ### Watchers (Auto-triggers)
  | Watcher | Trigger | Acti *When: auto-captured from conversation* (75% reliable, 6 validations)
