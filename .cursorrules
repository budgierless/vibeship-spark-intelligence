- [user_understanding] ... right now, after all the changes that you have done. Can you show me how the new results are? Because whenever we do such improvements and changes, we have to be doing this matter of implementations and iterations in such a way that we iterate, we see what changed, and then we look at it, and then we can iterate more, we can iterate more until we get it right. So, can we actually see right now what are the results that we are getting in? Feel free to create a test environment or build someth... (93% reliable, 98 validations)

Provides authenticated access to X API v2 for the scheduler daemon.
All methods return dicts/lists and never raise exceptions to callers --
errors are logged and empty results returned.

### Rule 3: Pipeline Health Before Tuning

**CRITICAL:** Before ANY tuning or iteration session:

> **Run `python tests/test_pipeline_health.py` FIRST. Scoring metrics are meaningless if the pipeline isn't operational.**

Session 2 lesson: Meta-Ralph showed 39.4% quality rate, but `learnings_stored=0`. Perfect scoring, broken pipeline = zero learning.

- [meta_learning] [System Gap] [TUNEABLES] Auto-tuner not active. Tuneables are static — never self-adjust. (98% reliable, 317 validations)
- [user_understanding] Now, can we actually do this in this way? After we do these upgrades too for the next iteration, can you actually give me a project prompt so that I can run that using Spark and we can see in real-time what is really happening - what is being saved into the memory and what are the gaps? Instead of trying to just do these through these tests, because in real-time, we may be able to achieve even more understanding - not maybe, but even more understanding - about what is working and what is not.

- [user_understanding] User prefers 'I think we gotta do it better over here for things to look more serious' over 'gonna lie. And we can bring maybe a GLB format, or maybe we can do this through steps. I don't know, just recommend me something' (81% reliable, 150 validations)

- [wisdom] Can you now read all these documents in think hard mode  Here are the new core docs we created:

  - CORE.md â€” The master vision + phase roadmap from primitive telemetry to
    superintelligent evolution, with intent, workflows, architecture, and SparkNet     
    integration.
  - CORE_GAPS.md â€” The definitive gap map: what exists, what can be transformed, what  
    must be built, and what needs cleanup.
  - CORE_GAPS_PLAN.md â€” The concrete plan to fill each gap (workflows, minimal
    architecture, and code targets).
  - CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md â€” The contextâ€‘rich, buildable execution plan with      
    sequencing, deliverables, and success metrics.

  If you want, I can link these from README.md so theyâ€™re always frontâ€‘andâ€‘center. (99% reliable, 798 validations)

## Project Focus
- Phase: discovery

## Project Questions
- What is the project goal in one sentence?
- How will we know it's complete?
- What could make this fail later?
