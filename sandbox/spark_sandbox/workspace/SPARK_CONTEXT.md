## Current Focus
sandbox validation

## Project Focus
- Phase: prototype
- Done means: End-to-end learning pipeline validated with stable report.
- Goal: Automate regression checks for Spark learning quality.

## Project Questions
- What could make this fail later?
- What quality signal matters most?
- Who gives feedback and how often?

## Relevant Right Now
- [self_awareness] I struggle with Edit_error tasks
- [user_understanding] User wanted: not that. Instead use a small diff and explain why.
- [mind:meta_learning] always Read before Edit.

## Relevant Skills
- [sandbox_skill] Sample skill for sandbox validation (owns: scenario design; delegates: test_runner)

## Spark Advisor Notes
### Cautions
- [Caution] I struggle with Edit_error tasks
### Relevant Learnings
- Consider skill [sandbox_skill]: Sample skill for sandbox validation 
- I struggle with Edit_error tasks (100% confident)
- User wanted: not that. Instead use a small diff and explain why.

## Warnings (avoid failures)
- [self_awareness] I struggle with Edit_error tasks

## Recognition (use sparingly in chat)
- Ground this in the user's preferences: User wanted: not that. Instead use a small diff and explain why.

## Proven Insights (act on these)
- [reasoning] Pattern 'Write -> Bash' works well: Create file then execute
- [self_awareness] I struggle with Edit_error tasks
- [meta_learning] always Read before Edit.
- [wisdom] Principle: Read before Edit
- [wisdom] Principle: this: always Read before Edit
