# On the Path to AGI — Index

This is the long-horizon knowledge system for Spark Intelligence.

## Sections
- `glossary/` — durable concepts and definitions
- `reports/` — deep-dive analyses and audits
- `experiments/` — hypotheses, interventions, outcomes
- `retros/` — periodic reflections and directional updates

## Writing rules
1. Prefer short, clear entries over long vague prose.
2. Every claim should be tied to observed behavior, data, or runs.
3. Mark confidence (`high` | `medium` | `low`) where uncertainty exists.
4. End each report/experiment with a keep/rollback/iterate decision.
5. Link forward: each doc should point to the next action.

## Core methodology
- Constraint-first
- Real-use validation over synthetic-only confidence
- Modular simplicity
- Frequent small commits + frequent documentation
