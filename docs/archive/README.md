# Archive

This folder stores superseded documentation that is kept for historical traceability.

- `root/`: archived docs that originally lived at repository root.
- `docs/`: archived docs that originally lived under `docs/`.
- `legacy_builder/`: docs from the earlier agent-startup-builder track.

Active documentation now lives in `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`.
