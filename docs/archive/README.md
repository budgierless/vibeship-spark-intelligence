# Archive

This folder stores superseded documentation that is kept for historical traceability.

- `root/`: archived docs that originally lived at repository root.
- `docs/`: archived docs that originally lived under `docs/`.
- `docs/reports_self_review/`: archived repetitive advisory self-review run logs.
- `legacy_builder/`: docs from the earlier agent-startup-builder track.

Active documentation now lives in `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`.

Recent archive moves:
- `docs/archive/docs/OPENCLAW_INTEGRATION_LEGACY.md` (superseded by `docs/OPENCLAW_OPERATIONS.md`)
- `docs/archive/docs/SPARK_EMOTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE1.md` (superseded by `docs/SPARK_EMOTIONS_V2.md`)
