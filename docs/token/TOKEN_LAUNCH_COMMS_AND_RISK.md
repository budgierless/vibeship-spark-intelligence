# Token Launch: Legal + Comms + Risk Checklist

Date: 2026-02-15

This document is NOT legal advice. It is a launch readiness checklist that must be reviewed with qualified legal/compliance professionals before public statements or distribution.

## 1) Public Narrative (Safe Defaults)

Keep it simple and verifiable:
- What is shipping: Spark Intelligence (local-first learning layer for coding agents)
- Why it matters: better outcomes over time through validated learnings
- What the token is NOT: a promise of profit, a guarantee, a speculative investment pitch

Avoid:
- price talk, “number go up” language, “guaranteed returns”
- implying listings, partnerships, endorsements unless signed and public
- “community will pump it” style content

## 2) Disclaimers (Minimum)

Every public token mention should include, at minimum:
- “Not investment advice.”
- “Do your own research.”
- “Tokens involve risk; you can lose the full amount.”
- “Availability may be restricted by jurisdiction.”

If any sale/airdrop/distribution is involved, add:
- “No offer or solicitation where unlawful.”
- “Eligibility requirements may apply.”

## 3) Legal/Compliance Checklist (Route To Counsel)

Bring this checklist to a qualified professional:

- Securities analysis (jurisdiction-specific):
  - Is it a security? What makes it one or not?
  - Distribution mechanics: sale, airdrop, vesting, lockups, utility timing
- Marketing/comms review:
  - claims substantiation (what can we prove)
  - influencer/KOL disclosures (paid vs unpaid)
- Consumer protection:
  - refunds, mistaken payments, support, dispute handling
- AML/KYC/sanctions (if applicable):
  - whether KYC is required for distribution or exchanges
- Tax:
  - treatment for the team and recipients (jurisdiction-specific)
- Data protection/privacy:
  - analytics tracking disclosures
  - retention of wallet addresses and support logs

## 4) Risk Register (Operational)

Track these as explicit “go/no-go” items:

- R1: Unreviewed legal positioning (block launch until counsel signoff)
- R2: Messaging drift (price/returns language) (block public comms)
- R3: Support load spike (prepare macros, KB, escalation ladder)
- R4: Scams/impersonation (verified accounts, pinned warnings, reporting)
- R5: Supply chain risk (publish hashes, signed tags, reproducible build notes)

## 5) FAQ (Safe Answers)

Q: Is this token an investment?
- A: We cannot provide investment advice. Consult a qualified professional.

Q: Will it be listed on exchanges?
- A: Do not announce listings until confirmed and public with the venue.

Q: What is the token for?
- A: Describe only current, shipped utility (not future hopes). If utility is future, say so explicitly and keep it non-promissory.

Q: Who can participate?
- A: Jurisdiction/eligibility restrictions may apply. Follow official updates and terms once published.

## 6) Launch Artifacts To Produce

- A one-pager: “Spark Intelligence launch” and how token fits (if it does)
- A risk-reviewed announcement pack (X posts, short/long)
- A scam warning post pinned on all official channels
- A support KB page and escalation process
