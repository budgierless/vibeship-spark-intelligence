## 6) Terms (open docs glossary)

- **Advisor**: Decision-time guidance produced from memory, retrieval, and event context.
- **Auto-tuner**: Feedback-driven optimizer that adjusts source boosts in tuneables based on effectiveness data. Validates via schema and tracks drift before writing.
- **Bridge cycle**: Periodic event capture + learning cycle. Hot-reloads tuneables at start of each cycle.
- **Chip**: Domain module for trigger/observer/mapping logic (present but premium-gated in OSS).
- **Cognitive insight**: Confidence-scored, actionability-annotated learned advice.
- **Context sync**: Process that publishes verified insights to runtime-facing context artifacts.
- **Drift (tuneables)**: Normalized distance between runtime `~/.spark/tuneables.json` and version-controlled `config/tuneables.json` baseline. Tracked by `lib/tuneables_drift.py`, alerts when >0.3.
- **EIDOS**: Episodic intelligence with mandatory prediction->outcome->evaluation loop. Budget-constrained episodes with phase-driven state machine.
- **Evidence gate**: Tunable confidence/quality threshold path for storing or rejecting learnings.
- **Hot-reload**: Mtime-based change detection for tuneables. Coordinator (`lib/tuneables_reload.py`) dispatches changed sections to registered module callbacks each bridge cycle.
- **Meta-Ralph**: Quality gate that scores insights 0-10. Threshold configurable via tuneables (default 4.5). Rejects noise, tautologies, platitudes.
- **Retrievers**: Routes incoming prompts/events to memory and domain-specific evidence.
- **Schema (tuneables)**: Central validation in `lib/tuneables_schema.py`. 25 sections, 153 keys with type, default, min/max bounds, descriptions. Clamps out-of-bounds values rather than rejecting.
- **Tuneables**: Runtime knobs in `~/.spark/tuneables.json`. Schema-validated, hot-reloaded each bridge cycle, drift-tracked against baseline. Reference: `TUNEABLES.md` and `docs/TUNEABLES_REFERENCE.md`.
