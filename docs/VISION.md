# Vision

Navigation hub: `docs/GLOSSARY.md`

This document consolidates long-range architecture intent from previous core and inference planning docs.

## North Star

Spark compounds useful intelligence over time by enforcing:
- prediction before action,
- outcome after action,
- validation-backed distillation,
- and reliable reuse during future decisions.

## Principles

1. Evidence over guess
2. Outcomes define truth
3. Operational telemetry is not cognitive memory
4. Reuse matters more than raw storage volume
5. Lightweight local-first defaults, scalable optional layers

## Architecture Direction

- Signal layer: event capture and trace-consistent envelopes
- Learning layer: quality gating, validation, distillation, semantic retrieval
- Application layer: advisor/context injection/promotion
- Governance layer: guardrails, control planes, and explicit rollback paths

## Strategic Tracks

- EIDOS enforcement and durable outcomes
- Meta-Ralph quality and feedback loop hardening
- Semantic retrieval with outcome-weighted ranking
- Chips as modular domain intelligence
- Project and team memory with measurable behavior change

## Important Deep Strategy Docs

The following remain active and intentionally unarchived:
- `MoE_Plan.md`
- `Path to AGI.md`
- `EVOLUTION_CHIPS_RESEARCH.md`

## How To Use This Vision

- Treat this as intent and direction.
- Treat `docs/PROGRAM_STATUS.md` as execution status.
- Treat `Intelligence_Flow.md` as runtime source-of-truth.
