Each H70 skill contains:\n- **identity**: Expert persona and deep knowledge\n- **owns**: What this skill handles\n- **delegates**: When to hand off to other skills\n- **disasters**: Real war stories and critical lessons\n- **anti_patterns**: Mistakes to avoid (with code smells)\n- **patterns**: Recommended implementations\n\n## Workflow Per Task\n\nFor each task in order:\n\n1. **Report Start**\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"type\":\"task_started\",\"missionId\":\"mission-1771186081212\",\"taskId\":\"TASK_ID\",\"taskName\":\"TASK_NAME\"}'\n   ```\n\n2. **Load Skills** - Fetch the H70 skills listed for this task (see \"Load H70 Skills\" in task)\n\n3. **Execute** - Complete the task following the skill's patterns, avoiding anti-patterns\n\n4. **Report Progress** (for long tasks)\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"type\":\"progress\",\"missionId\":\"mission-1771186081212\",\"taskId\":\"TASK_ID\",\"progress\":50,\"message\":\"Working on...\"}'\n   ```\n\n5. **Report Complete**\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"type\":\"task_completed\",\"missionId\":\"mission-1771186081212\",\"taskId\":\"TASK_ID\",\"taskName\":\"TASK_NAME\",\"data\":{\"success\":true}}'\n   ```\n\n6. **Move to Next Task** - Load the next task's skills and repeat\n\n## Completion Protocol\n\n### Per-Task Requirements\n1. **Load Skills First** - Report: `curl POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events {\"type\":\"skill_loaded\",\"skillId\":\"...\"}`\n2. **Execute Task** - Follow skill patterns, avoid anti-patterns\n3. **Report Progress** - At 25%, 50%, 75% for long tasks\n4. **Verify Before Complete** - Check artifacts exist, no errors\n\n### DO NOT\n- Skip feature tasks after infrastructure is set up\n- Mark tasks \"complete\" without verification\n- Ignore listed skills - they contain critical patterns\n- Rush to \"mission_completed\" - complete ALL tasks first\n\n### Task Completion Quality\nEach task should produce:\n- **Artifacts**: Files created/modified\n- **No Errors**: Code compiles, tests pass\n- **Skills Applied**: Patterns from loaded skills used\n\n## Mission Complete\n\nOnly send `mission_completed` after ALL 12 tasks are done:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"type\":\"mission_completed\",\"missionId\":\"mission-1771186081212\"}'\n```\n\nThe system will then run automated tests and generate a checkpoint for human review.\n\n## IMPORTANT: Resume After Interruption\n\nIf execution is interrupted (crash, pause, or context loss), you can resume:\n\n### 1. Check Active Mission State\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/mission/active\n```\n\nThis returns:\n- `active`: Whether there's a mission to resume\n- `completedTasks`: Tasks already finished (don't redo these)\n- `currentTask`: Task that was in progress when interrupted\n- `resumeInstructions`: Specific guidance on continuing\n\n### 2. Resume From Checkpoint\n- **Skip completed tasks** - Check `completedTasks` array\n- **Continue current task** - If `currentTask` is set, continue from where you left off\n- **Don't restart from beginning** - Only work on pending tasks\n\n### 3. If No Active Mission Found\nIf `active: false`, the mission was either completed or needs to be restarted.\nCheck `.spawner/active-mission.json` manually for state.\n\n### AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION RULES\n- **Do NOT stop to ask questions** during task execution\n- **Do NOT pause for confirmation** between tasks\n- **Complete all tasks sequentially** without human intervention\n- **Only pause if blocked** by an error you cannot resolve\n- If you must pause, report it: `{\"type\":\"mission_paused\",\"reason\":\"...\"}`\n\n---\n\n**START**: Begin with Task 1. Load its H70 skills first, then execute.\n**RESUME**: If resuming, check `/api/mission/active` first to see completed tasks.","resumeInstructions":"## Resume Instructions\n\n**Mission**: Spark Intelligence Launch Readiness (mission-1771186081212)\n**Progress**: 12/12 tasks completed\n\n### Current Task (In Progress)\n- **Task**: Post-Launch: Monitor + Retro + Patch Plan\n- **ID**: node-12-template\n\nContinue from where you left off on this task.\n\n### How to Resume\n1. Report task start: POST to /api/events with type \"task_started\"\n2. Report progress: POST to /api/events with type \"task_progress\"\n3. Report completion: POST to /api/events with type \"task_completed\"\n\n**Base URL**: http://localhost:5173\n","lastUpdated":"2026-02-15T20:50:12.572Z"}
