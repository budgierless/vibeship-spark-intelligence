## Spark Learnings

*Auto-promoted insights from Spark*

- User learns by building - figure it out as they go, hands-on *When: Learning style* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User prefers Try different angles - brute force approaches for unstuck_method *When: When unstuck_method is relevant* (100% reliable, 7 validations)
- User aversion: when we are using rounded corners for components *When: Chat message: I hate when we are using rounded cor* (100% reliable, 15 validations)
- RepetitionDetector (same reque *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 12 validations)
- User was satisfied after: Bash, Bash, Bash *When: Detected from satisfaction pattern* (100% reliable, 7 validations)
- User wanted: lets do more *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually in terms of the outputs that it can actually create? Meaning, even if it's not cloud itself *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually improve that? Something happened, but besides that, it was very good. *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 4 validations)
- User wanted: actually instead call that surprises and fetch from surprises because surprises has had more info ov *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually increase that length a little bit more so that we see a little bit more messages at once. *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User persistently asking about: spark, run, everthing *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 11 validations)
- User persistently asking about: model, url, decide *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User persistently asking about: going, lengthier, url *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 5 validations)
- User persistently asking about: now, spark, way *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 6 validations)
- User persistently asking about: intelligence, better, doing *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 4 validations)
- User believes in full test coverage - tests as documentation *When: Quality standards* (99% reliable, 174 validations)
- User prefers Works + tested + clean code for done_criteria *When: When done_criteria is relevant* (100% reliable, 49 validations)
- User wanted: lets do it diligently so that this really works *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (99% reliable, 285 validations)
- TEST: Users prefer dark mode for late-night coding *When: test_suite* (99% reliable, 539 validations)
- User wanted: let's do it in such a way that in these new systems that you have upgraded, you will see, "Oh, okay, *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (99% reliable, 191 validations)
- User prefers: the next 5 *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (100% reliable, 58 validations)
- Cognitive ins... *When: signals: ['preference', 'correction'], session: 40* (100% reliable, 5 validations)
- let's fix the pipeline issues - start bridge_worker please so that uh like we have basically 10 rules or 20 rules that we abide by always so that you know whatever we change uh tune uh whatever we grow from here after they're really you know real stuff they're gonna be about really improving Spark they're gonna be about really improving what Spark can do and uh no uh basically uh hallucination allowed nothing uh that goes uh in a way that it is not uh really done in the right way and other thing... *When: signals: ['preference', 'correction', 'reasoning']* (99% reliable, 547 validations)
- Continue to do these things in such a way that we abide by those rulesets always of you know honest assessments making sure that we are completely plugged in into our own spark intelligence systems. We know the intelligence_flow and if you want to add new rule sets into this so that cloud always follows this, I would appreciate it. Anything that we do has to really improve things instead of ever hallucinating. And what that means is actually everything has to be based on data flowing from the Sp... *When: signals: ['medium:conditional', 'preference', 'dec* (99% reliable, 193 validations)
