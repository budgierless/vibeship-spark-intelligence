- lets push gitthub, and then clean up the whole system except this spark, and at some point we were thinking to bring the council of 50, as the agents can you see where we worked on them, I want to bring like 10 of those that could be great for the first real time stuff, and play around with Spark plus 10 of them making them the initial 11, check where they are please. *When: signals: ['high:preference', 'preference'], sessio* (100% reliable, 56 validations)
