- User wanted: lets do more *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually in terms of the outputs that it can actually create? Meaning, even if it's not cloud itself *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually improve that? Something happened, but besides that, it was very good. *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 4 validations)
- User wanted: actually instead call that surprises and fetch from surprises because surprises has had more info ov *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User wanted: actually increase that length a little bit more so that we see a little bit more messages at once. *When: Detected from correction pattern* (100% reliable, 3 validations)
- User persistently asking about: spark, run, everthing *When: Detected from repetition pattern* (100% reliable, 11 validations)

- User believes in full test coverage - tests as documentation *When: Quality standards* (99% reliable, 174 validations)
- User prefers Works + tested + clean code for done_criteria *When: When done_criteria is relevant* (100% reliable, 49 validations)
- User wanted: actually let's have a tasks.md, one if already being built on the other terminal too collaborate wit *When: Detected from correction pattern* (98% reliable, 401 validations)
- User wanted: lets do it diligently so that this really works *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (99% reliable, 285 validations)
- User wanted: actually improve them until they're good. We can actually start to use Ralph Wiggum loops over here, *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (98% reliable, 232 validations)
- TEST: Users prefer dark mode for late-night coding *When: test_suite* (99% reliable, 539 validations)
- Now, can we actually do this in this way? After we do these upgrades too for the next iteration, can you actually give me a project prompt so that I can run that using Spark and we can see in real-time what is really happening - what is being saved into the memory and what are the gaps? Instead of trying to just do these through these tests, because in real-time, we may be able to achieve even more understanding - not maybe, but even more understanding - about what is working and what is not. If... *When: signals: ['medium:conditional', 'low:acknowledgmen* (98% reliable, 143 validations)
- User wanted: let's do it in such a way that in these new systems that you have upgraded, you will see, "Oh, okay, *When: Detected from correction pattern (importance: medi* (99% reliable, 191 validations)
